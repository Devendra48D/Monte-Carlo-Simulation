# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

As we can see from the output of running "random_walk.py" Python script, when considering random walks with up to 60 blocks, 
the largest walk length that has more than 50% of no transport or lyft ride required is walk length of 31 blocks. 

In this case the result of our simulation is 

## Walk size =  31 , % of no transport =  51.795 , Total cost of Lyft rides 96410 , Cost to blocks ratio 3110.0

But, if we consider all the random walks, the walk length which has the maximum percentage of no lyft ride required is walk legnth of 7 blocks. In this case, the result of our simulation is 

## Walk size =  7 , % of no transport =  96.925 , Total cost of Lyft rides 6150 , Cost to blocks ratio 878.571428571
